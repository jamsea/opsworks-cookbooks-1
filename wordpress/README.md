# Wordpress AWS OpsWorks cookbook
Extracts the Wordpress installation over the top of an OpsWorks app and builds the wp-config.php file.

## Usage
Include wordpress::deploy in your stack's Deploy phase run list.

If the project needs to specify additional config that would normally be in wp-config.php you can create a
file called wp-config-custom.php within the project.  This is conditionally required once after the other config has been applied.

Wordpress will only deployed if the app is listed in `['wordpress']['apps']` (array of Strings).  This allows other
non-Wordpress PHP apps to be deployed to the same node without polluting them.

### Plugins
Wordpress sites often have a lot of plugins to enable functionality.  Unfortunately, when operating in a fully automated
multi-server environment the tools used to manage WP plugins are not ideal - if the user installs/updates a plugin, how
it that then replicated the next time an instance starts?

To work around this the cookbook will install a list of plugins as part of its deployment from the stack configuration

    {
      "wordpress": {
        "apps" : [ "mywordpressappname" ],
        "plugins" : [{
	        "name" : "addthis",
            "download" : "http:://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/addthis.3.5.9.zip",
            "has_config" : false
        }]
      }
    }

The `has_config` boolean value indicates where there is additional configuration available for this plugin.  If true
 template/default/plugins/ will be searched for a partial erb template to merge into wp-config.php.  The partial template
should have the same name as the plugin with the .erb extension.

### Using a custom database
You may not want the DB to be setup within the OpsWorks stack, it might be an RDS instance or a box you manage.  By
default the cookbook will try to use the stack's database but you can switch this off by setting `use_stack_database`
false and supplying appropriate information:

    {
      "wordpress": {
        "apps" : [ "mywordpressappname" ],
        "use_stack_database" : false
        "db_name" : "somedb",
        "db_user" : "someusername",
        "db_password" : "somepassword",
        "db_host" : "somedatabasehost"
      }
    }

## Configuration
`['wordpress']['download']` - the URL of the distribution download.  Defaults to 'http://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz'.
Override this if you need to change the location of the distribution or pin to a specific version.

`['wordpress']['apps']` - an array of application name strings that should have Wordpress installed to them.  Must match
name given in OpsWorks.

`['wordpress']['use_stack_database']` - whether to use the stack's database or a user supplied one.

`['wordpress']['db_name']` - the name of the database to use.  Only applies if `use_stack_database` is false.

`['wordpress']['db_user']` - the username to connect to the database with.  Only applies if `use_stack_database` is false.

`['wordpress']['db_password']` - the password to connect to the database with.  Only applies if `use_stack_database` is false.

`['wordpress']['db_host']` - the FQDN or IP address to use when connecting to the database.  Only applies if `use_stack_database` is false.
